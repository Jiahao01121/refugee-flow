          <IntroParagraph>
            To leave oneâ€™s home country, community, and loved ones is a difficult prospect
            even in times of peace. As violence, persecution, and terror surge the only option for
            survival and security is to flee one's home.
          </IntroParagraph>
          <IntroParagraph>
            The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reports that as of 2017, 65.6 million
            people were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution, conflict, violence, and human
            rights violations.
          </IntroParagraph>
          <IntroParagraph>
            To become a refugee is to subject a person to the most pervasive form of cruelty by removing
            their basic need to lead a normal life. All aspects that make human life tolerable and meaningful
            are lost to the refugee. Refugees are placed in inhospitable host countries that do not want them.
            They face the brute indifference of the walls that people build between nations and cultures. Yet
            each refugee surrenders to the hardship of leaving their old lives and the lives they could have
            lived to find peace and safety elsewhere.
          </IntroParagraph>
          <IntroParagraph>Every refugee is an example of a world that failed to use its common strength for the common good.</IntroParagraph>

            <ExplanationParagraph>Refugee Flow gathers data from multiple reliable sources to construct a compelling account
              on how persons become refugees. This project examines one of the direct fundamental causes
              of the global refugee crisis, the collapse of order and stability in todays international
              landscape.
            </ExplanationParagraph>
            <ExplanationParagraph>This visualization examines the impact conflict, persecution and violence has on the lives of
              persons in their home countries and communities. The dataset delves into exploring what drives
              people to flee their homes and bear the burden of a life as a refugee.
            </ExplanationParagraph>
            <ExplanationParagraph>
              The project further explores the possible routes taken by refugees. The dataset examines the
              dangers those forcibly displaced face in their search for safety. Many refugees who depart
              on their journey never make it to their intended destination. The data collected presents the
              cause of these deaths along their chosen routes.
