To date, there were an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, or in other words, one out of every 113 people on Earth. The number are surpassing even post-World War II records, when the world was struggling to come to terms with the most devastating event in history. United Nations defined refugee as an individual who has been forced to leave their country due to political or religious reasons, or due to threat of war of violence. Among all the forcibly displaced people around the world, one third of them are categorized as refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.

In a world where nearly 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute as a result of armed conflict or persecution, this study is aim to visualize a distinct cause-effect view, beginning with how wars and armed conflicts lead to the insurmountable displaced crowd and transitioning into how seasonality play a important role of the deadly journey of flee out of their home country finding asylums.
