“Being a refugee… is the most pervasive kind of cruelty that can be exercised against a human being.”
    — Ai Weiwei

To date, there were an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, or in other words, one out of every 113 people on Earth, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)[1].  The number are surpassing even post-World War II records[2], when the world was struggling to come to terms with the most devastating event in history. United Nations defined refugee as an individual who has been forced to leave their country due to political or religious reasons, or due to threat of war of violence.[5] Among all the forcibly displaced people around the world, one third of them are categorized as refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.

After Second World War, The number of refugees start growing up from 2015[3], when rising numbers of people arrived in European Union(EU), traveling across the Mediterranean Sea or overland through Southeast Europe. Over half of all refugees come from Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia.[4] Among all these travelers trying to get to the their hosting countries, the number of death and missing along the road are uncountable. Yet, Non-governmental organizations around the world and voluntary groups among Journalist in Europe have invest substantial amount of time trying to get the most comprehensive record on missing/death refugees possible.

In a world where nearly 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute as a result of armed conflict or persecution[6], this study is aim to visualize a distinct cause-effect view, beginning with how wars and conflicts lead to the insurmountable displaced crowd and transitioning into how seasonality play a important role of the deadly journey of flee out of their home country finding asylums.
